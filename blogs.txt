Today we started working on Cloud Computing assignment. We started a call on Google Hangouts, as college has been till
the end of the semester. All of researched different resources on how to 'Create and connect web front end to a Cloud
SQL database'. The first thing we also did was create a Google Cloud Platform account.

Once we created account I started screensharing and we want through GCP together. Maksims has had previous experience
using GCP during his INTRA, especially Google App Engine services.

We came back couple of days later and decided that we are going to make a Django e-commerce app that allow users to put up items for sale. 
We will then host this application using Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL.
