Today we started working on Cloud Computing assignment. We started a call on Google Hangouts, as college has been till
the end of the semester. All of researched different resources on how to 'Create and connect web front end to a Cloud
SQL database'. The first thing we also did was create a Google Cloud Platform account.

Once we created account I started screensharing and we want through GCP together. Maksims has had previous experience
using GCP during his INTRA, especially Google App Engine services.
