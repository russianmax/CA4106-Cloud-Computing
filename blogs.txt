Today we started working on Cloud Computing assignment. We started a call on Google Hangouts, as college has been till
the end of the semester. All of researched different resources on how to 'Create and connect web front end to a Cloud
SQL database'. The first thing we also did was create a Google Cloud Platform account.

Once we created account I started screensharing and we want through GCP together. Maksims has had previous experience
using GCP during his INTRA, especially Google App Engine services.

Resources that found useful are:
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-app-engine - Tutorial provided
https://cloud.google.com/sql - Cloud SQL documentation
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python - App Engine documentation

We came back couple of days later and decided that we are going to make a Django e-commerce app that allow users to put up items for sale. 
We will then host this application using Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL.

Some other useful resources that we gathered are:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvRrldjf1Y - How to Build an E-commerce Website with Django and Python
https://medium.com/@BennettGarner/deploying-a-django-application-to-google-app-engine-f9c91a30bd35 - How to deploy Django app to GAE

Josh created test and prod directories. Test will be mainly used for development/testing and then code will be transfered to
prod once we are happy with how the app works.

We also decided that we will call our web-app Prestige Worldwide - market place for your needs

We decided that Matthew and Maksims will mainly focus on the development of the app (Django). Josh will focus on connecting
the app to Cloud SQl and Michael will look at the deployment side of things. Tutorial that we are going to follow to develop our
application can be found here:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p - Django tutorial

In order to deploy and connect our application to Google App Engine and Cloud SQL, the app will have to be developed first.
We will try write this app in the next couple of days. This will give Michael and Josh time to research and figure out how to deploy
using App Engine and how to connect Django to Cloud SQL.

As Django uses SQLite3 be default, we will need to change from SQLite 3 to PostgreSQL or MySQL for this to work.

Michael done some research and found some really good tutorial on how to Connect to Cloud SQL from App Engine in Google Cloud.
It is a really good tutorial, it shows what we need to do but uses Flask and MySQL instead.

Maksims have wrote basic functionality of the app. The app at the moment allows users to create profile and sign in. This
was achieved by creating a Profile model and using in built Django auth_users functionality. This functionality will allow users
of our site to authenticate easily. Next Matthew will write a Model that will create a new table in the database. This table will
contain any items that are put up for sale on our site. Once the model is created it will allows us to query the database
and display the items on the homepage.

We will also need to create a form, that will allow us to gather information about the items that they want to sell, such as the photo, name,
price and contact number. A simple view then will need to be written to display these items in the homepage.
